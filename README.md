# Why
Endless templates generate code quickly.  But what happens when you want to update it?  And wouldn't it be nice if you someone else would deal with the constant bot security complaints about packages in the code you've inherited?

The hard part of software development isn't usually building it, but rather maintaining it. Good software constantly evolves. 

Today, software is made from endless packages evolving under our feet. This CLI was created to leverage external package maintenance with minimal refactoring.  It's intended for both template developers and users.

# What
ns-front (short for "No Stack Front") is CLI for front end templates that can be exchanged as easily as WordPress themes.  You can create templates for yourself or others that have regions built in for customized code.  Then users of the template can upgrade easily, or even exchange templates within a category, without losing their custom changes.

(By category we mean the 'type' of produced app.  That is vague, and we may soon support more specific classifications, but in general a category should include a front end framework and probably a type of expected back end.)

Currently, a template must be stored in a repo and distributed separately, and must conform to required standards explained below.

#Features
* A `newapp` command to generate an "empty" placeholder app of the type used by a template.  (The way that `create-react-app` creates a placeholder React app.) The template specifies how such a placeholder gets created, so if you like you can use ns-front to let others generate some unique type of application.
* A command `makecode` that generates an app from a template.
* A `test` command to be sure that no custom code that the template user created violates the standards for the template. The test ensures that custome code conforms to the [NoStack Front End Guidelines](https://bit.ly/nsFrontEndRules). (Otherwise, you could lose your custom code when you update your template!)
* A flexible, hierarchical approach: rather than limiting an app to standard pages (you know, a cookie cutter), a template relies upon a flexible specification with the units and hierarchies of components that you need in your app. Also, a template can (and should) allow for custom styling, so that any mockup can be used with a decent template.
* Easy to use: Simple handlebars with a simple standard structure for templates.
* [Coming Soon] A searchable list for registering templates, so that if you create a template others can find it.
* Templates that support the [NoStack](https:www.nostack.net) service also can be used with autogenerated backends, so that you can throw together and then modify your whole stack with minimal code.

# History of the Project
We created this because we needed it at [NoStack](https:www.nostack.net).  Originally, we created a tool that was specific to our needs.  But then we realized that it would support a lot more people if we made it more generic.

So, we turned it into a tool that supports any type of template. 
Unfortunately, there's a problem as of today that you need an extra file ("stack.json") that most people won't have (see issue 1).  That's our top priority to remove today. But we have to release our current version, because we're still using it ourselves.  So, if you want to use this *right now*, contact us about generating one for you (info at nostack dot net).  Meanwhile, we're on it...
 
 So far we've got [one template](https://github.com/YizYah/basicNsFrontTemplate), and we are pulling together the documentation.

If you want to help with this project, please [open issues](https://github.com/https://github.com/NoStackApp/ns-front/issues) and start talking to us!  Or just reach out to info at nostack dot net.

```

_See code: [@oclif/plugin-help](https://github.com/oclif/plugin-help/blob/v3.2.0/src/commands/help.ts)_

## `nsfront makecode`

generates or updates code from a template, preserving custom changes. The app directory should have been prepared the first time with a call to `newapp`

```
USAGE
  $ nsfront makecode

OPTIONS
  -a, --appDir=appDir  application directory
  -h, --help           show CLI help

EXAMPLE
  $ nostack makecode -a ~/temp/myapp

## `nsfront newapp`

new placeholder app.  Creates an "empty" app (like create-react-app) for a template that you can build on with makecode.

```
USAGE
  $ nsfront newapp

OPTIONS
  -a, --appDir=appDir            application directory
  -b, --baseApp=baseApp          directory of the base app to copy. If it does not exist, it is created.
  -h, --help                     show CLI help
  -t, --templateDir=templateDir  template directory

EXAMPLE
  $ nostack newapp -t ~/templates/basicTemplate -a ~/temp/myapp -b ~/temp/baseapp
```

## `nsfront test`

Confirms that your code is not violating any of the rules for testing required by nostack.  For documentation about those rules, please see https://bit.ly/nsFrontEndRules.  This is actually one of the tests conducted by NoStack to gauge the quality of submitted code.  Essentially, the test generates a new version of the code and then simply compares it against your current version.  If there are differences, then there is a problem with your code.

```
USAGE
  $ nsfront test

OPTIONS
  -a, --appDir=appDir  application directory
  -h, --help           show CLI help

EXAMPLE
  $ nsfront test -a ~/temp/myApp
```

#Using Templates
Follow these steps:
1. Clone the template to your local.
2. Call `nsfront newapp -t <template dir> -a <placeholder app directory>` and the placeholder app will be created wherever you specified. This step may take some time (for instance, if the template has to install a lot of packages).
3. Copy your placeholder app to a new app directory (or just use the placeholder itself).
4. Open the `app.yml` file in the "meta" directory.  You need to replace `myApp` with the name that you want, and if necessary globally replace `user` with whatever you want for the user for that app, e.g. `buyer`.  
5. You need to create a set of units under units. The symantic meaning of a unit will vary depending upon the template, but you can roughly think of them as pages or screens in your app. Each one must have a `hierarchy` of data types.  See [Creating a Data Type Hierarchy](##Creating a Data Type Hierarchy) below.
6. Call `makecode` to generate your app code according to the template.
7. Add custom code in accordance with  
You can update the template whenever you like. Just bear in mind the following wa

##Creating a Data Type Hierarchy
A Unit is a building block for an app user interface.  It also can be a query to the back end.  `ns-front` expects a hierarchy of data types for each unit.  So a 'unit' in `ns-front` terms is a hierarchy of types where each type appears only once in that unit  More complex interfaces can be built with joining units, which provides complete querying expressive power.

You can, of course, start simple and build them up.  Any time you like, you can call `makecode` and it will modify the code that you have so far to include changes to your units and their hierarchies.

To create a hierarchy, think in terms of what you want to display.  If for instance you expect to show a list of watches as the highest level of a UI unit, then your hierarchy should be rooted in watches.  Maybe for each watch you will have a list of sellers.  
```
catalog:
    hierarchy:
        watch:
            store:
                location: null
                hours: null
                phone: null
        cost: null
```
But if you want the sellers to be shown on the top with the watches that they carry, then you'd reverse that.
 
```
catalog:
    hierarchy:
        store:
            location: null
            hours: null
            phone: null
            watch
                cost: null
```
You can extend a hierarchy as many levels deep as you like.  When a type has no child types, it should receive the value of null.

Note that nothing is stated in the hierarchy about data type.  Every type in a hierarchy can be a string, a number, a or a set.  By default, everything is a string.  When you want to generate a backend as well, you need to provide more information. But to start you can try producing something with just strings.

#Working with Test Results
The diff files in `<appPath>.test/diffs` show a number of problems.  If you understand what's happening, the solutions are usually straightforward, but it may seem confusing at first. 

It helps to understand clearly that your code files in `<appPath>/src/components` are being compared to generated versions in `<appPath>.test/src/components`.  You may want to learn the basics of `diff` outputs if you haven't already.

The problems (and their likely causes and solutions) are shown below.  They can be one of the following:
1. There are lines in the generated test code that do not appear in yours.  That would indicate that you removed some code, or that something in the version of your ns-front is more uptodate than the version used to generate your code.  The solution is to add those lines to your code in the line number indicated, and then to try the test again.
2. Your code has lines not in the generated code.  That usually indicates that you added code in places not permitted in the code.  You need to insert all of your custom code in ns-custom areas, or to replace a section of the generated code using the "replacement" delimiter.  It's always preferred to place code into a custom area rather than replacing, but if you must then replacement works.  
3. Your code is simply different.  That situation can arise from one of two situations:
  a. You may simply need to lint your code and remove linting errors.  For instance, it could be that your code using a double quote and the generated code uses a single quote. 
  b. Your code may have missing or altered comment lines for delimiting sections or custom code areas. You may have to look at the generated code a bit to identify the discrepancies.
4. Your code has files that don't appear in the generated code.  You need to move them to the `src/custom` directory.
5. The generated code has files that don't appear in your code.  That normally means that you deleted a generated file.  Technically, that doesn't pose an immediate problem, given that in the worst case a future regeneration of code will add a file.  But the deletion won't last.  Probably there's a better solution by replacement of sections, possibly incorporating code or components programmed within the `src/custom` directory.

# Creating Templates
To create templates, you have to know the basics of handlebars.  (It's a very simple language to learn.)

It's also helpful to understand clearly that ns-front templates generate two types of files:
1. _type files_ are files generated for particular data types in an app's hierarchy.  That hierarchy is dynamically determined from an `app.yml` file when `nsfront makecode` is run.  For instance, if an app uses watches, there may be a type `watch` in the `app.yml` file, and there may be multiple component files created for watches, included `Watch.jsx`, `Watches.jsx` and `CreateWatchForm.jsx`.
2. _standard files_ are always generated, regardless of specifics about the app.  So for instance every app may contain a standard file `client.js`.

A template is a directory containing the following:
* A `config.yml` file telling various configurations.
* A general file template `generic.hbs` from which files for data are generated (see below).
* a `fileTemplates` directory containing handlebars templates for the standard files. Files should have an `.hbs` extension.  You can create any number of subdirectories.
* An optional `partials` directory containing handebars partials files.  As with `fileTemplates, you can add any number of subdirectories.  NsFront will read in your partials before generating files and you can make reference to them in your template files.
